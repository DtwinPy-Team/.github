# ðŸ§© DtwinPy Team
Welcome to the Lego Factory repository of the Politecnico di Milano! This repository is a part of our ongoing efforts to develop a comprehensive digital twin framework for manufacturing systems. Here, you will find the main Digital Twin repository along with various supporting repositories for papers and challenges.

## ðŸŽ¯ Goal
Our goal is to create a powerful and versatile digital twin framework that leverages the concept of discrete event simulation in real time. The framework enables us to model and simulate manufacturing systems accurately, allowing for better understanding, analysis, and optimization of their operations.

## ðŸ“š Repository Structure
Digital Twin Repository: The main repository containing the core components and functionalities of the digital twin framework.
Paper Repositories: Individual repositories dedicated to each research paper, providing additional resources and information related to specific topics.
Challenge Repositories: Repositories associated with challenges, fostering collaboration and showcasing innovative approaches within the digital twin domain.

## ðŸ“‹ Project Details
The heart of our digital twin framework lies in the dtwinpy library, a Python-based solution that utilizes discrete event simulation techniques. The library encompasses both internal and external services:

- **Internal Services:** The framework includes essential services such as synchronization and validation, ensuring the accuracy and reliability of the digital twin's representation of the manufacturing system.

- **External Services:** Our framework also offers monitoring and production control capabilities based on the prediction of the remaining cycle time. This feature enables real-time insights, facilitating informed decision-making and efficient production control.
